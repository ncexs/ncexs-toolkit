## ❓ FAQ

**🔹 Is it safe to use?**
Yes. The toolkit is fully open-source and regularly verified with VirusTotal. All critical actions (like deletions) require your mandatory **(Y/N)** confirmation before running.

**🔹 Will the Junk Cleaner log me out of my browsers?**
**No.** The Enhanced Junk Cleaner is designed to only remove **Cache, Code Cache, and GPU Cache**. It does **NOT** touch your Cookies, Saved Passwords, or History. You will stay logged in.

**🔹 Does "Compact OS" slow down my computer?**
Generally, no. Compact OS is a native Windows feature designed for SSDs. On modern CPUs, the performance impact is negligible, and it can actually make the system feel snappier by reducing disk I/O usage.

**🔹 Why does the Health Check (DISM) seem stuck?**
Commands like `DISM /RestoreHealth` often pause at specific percentages (e.g., 62.3%) for a long time. **This is normal**. It is downloading and verifying system files in the background. Please be patient and do not close the window.

**🔹 Why does it require Administrator rights?**
Most features—such as cleaning system temp files, optimizing drives, and repairing network settings—require elevated privileges to modify protected Windows system components.
